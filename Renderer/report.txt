What my code does:
  * Reads polygons and the light source from a given file
  * Marks hidden polygons
  * Computes the shading of each polygon using Gauraud shading
  * Renders with the z-buffer
  * Renders 99.9% whisker/hole free
  * Scene can be rotated, scaled, and translated by the user
  * Additional light sources can be dynamically added, modified, and removed from the scene

Notes:
  * I did not follow the edgelist code from the lecture slides, instead coming up with my own method.
    The reason for this was when I tried to implement the code, it turned out quite buggy, with whiskers
    everywhere. I spent some time with a pen and a bit of paper and worked out another method that ended
    up working *a lot* better.
  * In my scene rotations, I chose not to rotate the light souce as I wanted it to act more like the
    model was being rotated in the scene, rather than the camera moving around the scene. My reason for
    this is simply that I thought it looked cooler ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

How my program was tested:
  * When first creating my program, I tested it with the provided test classes
  * Later on, once I had started getting it to render, most of my testing became stepping through the
    code with a debugger attached. It was certainly a painful time trying to fix the edgelist code

Unresolved bugs:
  * Sometimes there may be *tiny* whiskers. I have decided that since they're so small, they aren't
    worth trying to fix, as it may make things that usually render properly no longer look correct.
